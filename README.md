### What We're Setting Up

We're going to download all the pre-built tools and files you need to create your AI movie assistant. Think of this as getting your workshop materials ready! Don't worry - everything has been prepared for you, and we'll walk through each step together.

### Step 1: Download the Lab Files

**Option A: Using the Command Line (Recommended)**

If you're comfortable opening a terminal/command prompt:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mouadzeghraoui/AI-for-Good---Summer-Camp.git
cd AI-for-Good---Summer-Camp
```

**What this does:** Downloads all the lab files to your computer and opens the project folder.

### Step 2: Check You Have Everything

Your project folder should now contain these key items (don't worry about understanding everything yet!):

```
cinema-agent-lab/
├── 🔧 tools/                        # The "superpowers" your AI will have

## Part 1: Meet Your AI Assistant's Superpowers

### What Are We Building?

Imagine having a personal movie assistant that's smarter than any app you've used before. Your AI assistant will be able to:

🎬 **Find the perfect movie** - "Show me funny movies playing tonight" → Instantly gets a curated list  
🏢 **Locate cinemas and showtimes** - "Where can I watch this near me?" → Finds theaters with exact times  
🎫 **Actually book your tickets** - "Book 2 seats for the 7pm show" → Handles the entire reservation process  

**The cool part?** It can connect all these abilities together in one conversation, just like talking to a really knowledgeable friend who happens to have access to every movie database in the world!

### Your AI's Three Superpowers

Think of your AI assistant as having three specialized "team members," each with their own expertise:

#### 🎬 The Movie Expert
**What it does:** Your personal film critic and recommendation engine
- Knows about thousands of current movies
- Can search by genre, popularity, or specific titles
- Provides ratings, cast info, and plot summaries
- Gives personalized recommendations based on your preferences

#### 🏢 The Cinema Scout
**What it does:** Your local theater and showtime specialist
- Finds cinemas near any location you specify
- Gets real-time showtime information
- Knows which theaters are playing which movies
- Can tell you exactly when and where to catch your film

#### 🎫 The Booking Agent
**What it does:** Your personal ticket reservation assistant
- Checks seat availability in real-time
- Collects your booking information
- Processes payments and confirmations
- Sends you booking confirmations via email

### How They Work Together

Here's where it gets really impressive - your AI doesn't just have these tools, it knows **when and how** to use them together:

**You:** "I want to see a good action movie tonight in downtown"  
**AI:** Uses Movie Expert → finds action movies → Uses Cinema Scout → locates nearby theaters → Shows you options  

**You:** "Book the 9pm showing at Cinema XYZ"  
**AI:** Uses Booking Agent → checks availability → collects your info → confirms reservation

### AI Agent Terminology: "Superpowers" = "Tools"

Now that you understand what these capabilities do, let's learn the proper AI terminology:

**In AI agent language, these "superpowers" are called "tools."** 

- 🎬 Movie Expert = **Movie Search Tool**
- 🏢 Cinema Scout = **Cinema Tool** 
- 🎫 Booking Agent = **Booking Tool**

Throughout this lab, you'll see both terms used - think of "tools" as the technical name for your AI's superpowers!

### The Magic Behind the Scenes

Each tool is actually a Python program that connects to real movie databases and booking systems. But here's what makes this special - **you don't need to know how to code these tools!** They're already built and ready to use.

#### What Does a Tool Actually Look Like?

Here's the basic structure of any watsonx Orchestrate tool (don't worry about memorizing this!):

```python
@tool(name="movie_search", description="Finds movies by genre or title")
def search_movies(genre: str, region: str) -> str:
    """
    Searches for movies based on your preferences
    """
    # The actual code that does the movie searching
    return "List of movies found"
```

**Breaking it down:**
- `@tool` = Special marker that tells watsonx Orchestrate "Hey, the AI can use this!"
- `search_movies` = The function name (what the AI calls)
- `genre: str, region: str` = What information the tool needs to work
- `return "List of movies found"` = What the tool gives back to the AI

**Think of it like a recipe:** The AI knows the tool's name, what ingredients it needs, and what it will produce!

**What we'll focus on:** How your AI **thinks** and **decides** which tool to use when, and how to make it even smarter at helping users.

### But First, We Need to Connect to the Outside World

Before your AI can use these amazing tools, we need to give them access to real movie databases and cinema systems. Think of it like giving your AI the "keys" to connect to:

- **TMDb (The Movie Database)** - Where your Movie Search Tool gets all its film information
- **MovieGlu** - Where your Cinema Tool finds real showtimes and booking data

Don't worry - this setup is automated and will only take a few minutes!

---

## Part 2: Giving Your AI Access to the Outside World

### What's an API? (And Why Do We Need Them?)

Think of APIs like **phone numbers for websites**. Just like you need someone's phone number to call them, your AI needs these special "phone numbers" (called APIs) to call movie databases and get real information.

**Without APIs:** Your AI would be like a person locked in a room with no internet - it could only guess about movies!

**With APIs:** Your AI can instantly "call" real movie databases and get up-to-date information about what's playing, where, and when.

### The Two "Phone Numbers" We Need

#### 🎬 TMDb (The Movie Database) 
**What it is:** Like the Wikipedia of movies - has information about millions of films
**What our AI gets from it:** Movie details, ratings, cast info, plot summaries, genres
**Think of it as:** Your AI's movie encyclopedia

#### 🏢 MovieGlu
**What it is:** The real-time system that knows what's playing at actual cinemas
**What our AI gets from it:** Live showtime data, cinema locations, booking availability  
**Think of it as:** Your AI's connection to real movie theaters

### Setting Up the Connections

Don't worry - we've automated this process! Follow these steps carefully:

**Step 1:** Open your terminal/command prompt
- **Mac:** Press `Cmd + Space`, type "Terminal", press Enter
- **Windows:** Press `Win + R`, type "cmd", press Enter (or use Git Bash if you have it)

**Step 2:** Navigate to your project folder:
```bash
cd cinema-agent-lab
```

**Step 3:** Make the script executable and run it:

**For Mac/Linux:**
```bash
chmod +x setup-connections.sh
./setup-connections.sh
```

**For Windows (using Command Prompt):**
```bash
bash setup-connections.sh
```

**For Windows (using Git Bash):**
```bash
chmod +x setup-connections.sh
./setup-connections.sh
```

**What this does:** Automatically creates secure connections to both movie databases using pre-configured credentials.

### Verify Everything Worked

After running the setup, check that your connections were created:

```bash
orchestrate connections list
```

**You should see:**
- ✅ `tmdb_api` - Your connection to The Movie Database
- ✅ `movieglu_api` - Your connection to real cinema data

**If you don't see these:** Don't worry! Ask your instructor - this is a common step where students need help.

### What Just Happened?

Think of what we just did like **giving your AI a contact list**:

📞 **Before:** Your AI had no way to get real movie information  
📞 **After:** Your AI now has the "phone numbers" to call two major movie databases  

**The cool part:** Your AI tools will automatically use these connections when they need real data. You don't have to think about it again!

**Security note:** The API credentials (like passwords) are kept secure and separate from your code - this is a best practice in the tech industry.

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

**"Permission denied" error:**
- Try: `chmod +x setup-connections.sh` then run the script again

**"orchestrate command not found":**
- Your instructor needs to help set up watsonx Orchestrate access

**Connections don't show up:**
- Double-check you're in the `cinema-agent-lab` folder
- Try running the list command again - sometimes there's a delay

**Script runs but nothing happens:**
- Check if there are any error messages printed
- Ask your instructor to verify the setup

## Part 3: Activating Your AI's Superpowers

### From Concept to Reality

Remember those three superpowers we learned about in Part 1? And the API connections we just set up in Part 2? Now comes the exciting part - **we're going to install these superpowers into your AI!**

Think of it like this:
- **Part 1:** We learned about amazing apps (tools) your AI could have
- **Part 2:** We gave your AI internet access (API connections) 
- **Part 3:** Now we're installing those apps so your AI can actually use them!

### What Does "Importing Tools" Mean?

When we "import tools" into watsonx Orchestrate, we're essentially:

📱 **Teaching your AI new skills** - Like showing someone how to use a new app  
🧠 **Giving it new capabilities** - Your AI learns what tools are available and how to use them  
🔗 **Connecting everything together** - The tools can now use those API connections we set up  

**Before importing:** Your AI is smart but has no special abilities  
**After importing:** Your AI becomes a movie expert with real superpowers!

### Installing Your AI's Superpowers

Time to bring your movie assistant to life! We'll use another automated script:

**Step 1:** Make sure you're still in the project folder:
```bash
cd cinema-agent-lab
```

**Step 2:** Before running the script, replace "XY" with your initials:

**IMPORTANT:** To avoid naming conflicts with other students, you must replace "XY" with your initials in the agent name:

1. Open `agents/cinema_agent.yaml` in a text editor
2. Find the line: `name: XY_CineMate`
3. Replace "XY" with your initials (e.g., `name: JS_CineMate` for John Smith)
4. Save the file

**Step 3:** Run the import script:

**For Mac/Linux:**
```bash
chmod +x import-all.sh
./import-all.sh
```

**For Windows (using Command Prompt):**
```bash
bash import-all.sh
```

**For Windows (using Git Bash):**
```bash
chmod +x import-all.sh
./import-all.sh
```

**What this script does:**
1. 🎬 Installs your **Movie Expert** (3 different movie search abilities)
2. 🏢 Installs your **Cinema Scout** (4 different cinema/showtime abilities)  
3. 🎫 Installs your **Booking Agent** (4 different reservation abilities)
4. 🤖 Sets up your complete **Cinema Agent** configuration

### Verify Your AI Got Its Superpowers

Check that all tools were successfully imported:

```bash
orchestrate tools list
```

**You should see 11 new tools:** ✨
- `search_movies`, `get_movie_details`, `get_movie_recommendations` (Movie Expert)
- `find_cinemas_nearby`, `get_cinema_showtimes`, `search_film_by_title`, `check_film_showtimes` (Cinema Scout)  
- `check_seat_availability`, `create_booking`, `process_payment`, `get_booking_status` (Booking Agent)

**If you see all 11 tools:** 🎉 Congratulations! Your AI is now fully powered up!

**If some tools are missing:** Don't worry - ask your instructor for help.

### What Just Happened? 

Your AI has been transformed! Here's the amazing progression:

🤖 **Before:** A smart AI that could only chat  
📞 **After Part 2:** An AI with access to real movie databases  
⚡ **After Part 3:** A complete movie assistant with 11 specialized abilities!

Your AI now knows:
- How to search for movies by genre, title, or popularity
- How to find cinemas and get real showtime data
- How to check availability and book actual tickets
- **Most importantly:** WHEN to use each tool based on what you ask!

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

**"Permission denied" error:**
```bash
chmod +x import-all.sh
```
Then try running the script again.

**"orchestrate command not found":**
- Ask your instructor to verify watsonx Orchestrate is properly set up

**Tools don't appear in the list:**
- Wait 30 seconds and try `orchestrate tools list` again
- Check if there were any error messages during import
- Ask your instructor to help debug

**Script runs but shows errors:**
- Don't panic! Some warnings are normal
- As long as you see the 11 tools in the list, you're good to go

### Ready to Configure Your AI's Brain?

Your AI now has all its superpowers installed and connected to real movie databases. Next, we'll configure how your AI thinks and decides which tools to use - this is where the real magic happens!

## Part 4: Teaching Your AI How to Think

### The Final Piece: Your AI's Decision-Making Brain

Amazing progress! Your AI now has:
- ✅ **Superpowers** (tools) installed *(Part 1)*
- ✅ **Internet access** (API connections) to real data *(Part 2)*  
- ✅ **All abilities** activated and ready *(Part 3)*

But there's one crucial thing missing: **Your AI doesn't know HOW to think and decide which tool to use when!**

Think of it like this:
🧠 **Before configuration:** Your AI has 11 amazing tools but no idea when to use them
🎯 **After configuration:** Your AI becomes a smart decision-maker who knows exactly what to do

### What Is Agent Configuration?

Agent configuration is like **writing an instruction manual for your AI's brain**. We're teaching it:

📋 **Personality** - How should it talk to users?  
🤔 **Decision rules** - When should it use the Movie Expert vs Cinema Scout?  
⚡ **Behavior patterns** - Should it search for showtimes automatically, or wait for users to ask?  
🎯 **Response style** - How detailed should its answers be?

### Your AI's "Instruction Manual"

Let's explore what we've configured for your movie assistant:

#### 🧠 The AI Model (Its "Brain Type")
**What we chose:** `llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct-fp8`  
**What this means:** We're using a powerful, large language model that's great at reasoning and decision-making  
**Think of it as:** Choosing a really smart "brain" for your AI

#### ⚡ The Thinking Style: "React" 
**What "react" means:** Your AI can **R**eason, **A**ct (use tools), and **O**bserve results  
**Why this matters:** This lets your AI think step-by-step and use tools intelligently  
**Example:** User asks "Find action movies" → AI **reasons** "I need movie data" → **acts** by using Movie Expert → **observes** the results → responds to user

#### 🎯 Smart Decision Rules

We've programmed your AI with specific "common sense" rules:

**Rule 1: Don't be overeager**
- When someone asks "what movies are playing" → ONLY search for movies, don't automatically find showtimes
- Wait for the user to specifically ask for showtimes or cinemas

**Rule 2: Be helpful but not overwhelming**  
- Provide good information without bombarding users with everything at once
- Ask follow-up questions to understand what users really want

**Rule 3: Use tools logically**
- Movie search first, then cinema search, then booking (logical order)
- Don't jump straight to booking without knowing what movie they want

### See Your AI's Instructions in Action

Here's a simplified version of what we told your AI:

```
You are a helpful movie assistant. Your job is to help users:
1. Find movies they might enjoy
2. Locate nearby cinemas and showtimes  
3. Book tickets when requested

IMPORTANT BEHAVIOR RULES:
- When users ask about "movies playing" → Use ONLY movie search tools
- Only search for cinemas/showtimes when specifically asked
- Always be friendly and ask clarifying questions
- Guide users through the booking process step-by-step
```

### The Magic Moment: Everything Connected

Your AI now has **everything it needs**:

🎬 **Movie Expert** + 🏢 **Cinema Scout** + 🎫 **Booking Agent** + 🧠 **Smart Decision Making**

**The result?** A truly intelligent assistant that can:
- Understand what you're asking for
- Decide which tools to use (and in what order)
- Get real data from movie databases
- Have natural conversations while being helpful

### What Makes This Special?

Unlike simple apps that only do one thing, your AI can:

💡 **Adapt to conversations** - No rigid menu options  
🔄 **Handle complex requests** - "Find a good sci-fi movie playing tonight in downtown and book me a ticket"  
🎯 **Make smart decisions** - Knows not to search for showtimes unless you want them  
🤝 **Learn from context** - Remembers what you discussed earlier in the conversation

### Ready to See Your AI in Action?

Your movie assistant is now complete! It has:
- Real superpowers (tools) ✨

🏢 **Act like a local guide** - Finding the perfect cinema and showtimes  
🎫 **Work like a personal assistant** - Handling the entire booking process  

**Most amazingly:** It does all this through natural conversation, just like talking to a knowledgeable friend!

### Scenario 1: Movie Discovery - "What Should I Watch?"

Let's start with the most common request - finding something good to watch.

**Your mission:** Ask your AI about movies and watch how intelligently it responds.

**Try asking:**
> "What sci-fi movies are playing this weekend?"

**What to watch for:**
- ✅ Your AI should use ONLY the Movie Expert (search tools)
- ✅ It should give you a nice list of sci-fi movies
- ✅ It should ask if you want more information
- ❌ It should NOT automatically search for showtimes or cinemas

**Why this matters:** This shows your AI has learned to be helpful without being overwhelming - it answers exactly what you asked for!

**Example of what you might see:**
```
🤖 AI: Here are the sci-fi movies currently playing:

1. Jurassic World Rebirth (Rating: 6.5)
2. 28 Years Later (Rating: 7.2) 
3. M3GAN 2.0 (Rating: 7.2)
4. Superman (Rating: 5.7)
5. Elio (Rating: 6.8)

Would you like showtimes for any of these movies, or more details about any particular film?
```

### Scenario 2: The Natural Progression - "Where Can I Watch It?"

Now let's see your AI's decision-making in action as you ask for the next logical step.

**Continue the conversation:**
> "Show me showtimes for M3GAN 2.0 in Paris"

**What to watch for:**
- ✅ Your AI should use the Cinema Scout tools
- ✅ It should find real cinemas showing that movie
- ✅ It should show you cinema names and locations
- ✅ It might show how many showtimes each cinema has

**The amazing part:** Your AI remembers the movie context from your previous question and builds on it!

**Example response:**
```
🤖 AI: Here are cinemas showing M3GAN 2.0 in Paris:

🏢 UGC Ciné Cité Les Halles (0.6 km) - 2 showtimes
🏢 Pathé Parnasse Premium (1.6 km) - 1 showtime  
🏢 MK2 Bibliothèque (2.1 km) - 2 showtimes

Would you like specific times for any cinema?
```

### Scenario 3: Getting Specific - "What Times Exactly?"

Let's go deeper and see your AI handle detailed requests.

**Ask for specifics:**
> "What are the specific times at UGC Ciné Cité Les Halles?"

**What to watch for:**
- ✅ Your AI gets detailed showtime information
- ✅ It shows you actual screening times
- ✅ It maintains the conversational flow

**The intelligence on display:** Your AI understands you're interested in that specific cinema and gets exactly what you need!

### Scenario 4: The Complete Experience - "Book My Ticket!"

Now for the grand finale - let's see your AI handle the full booking process.

**Try this realistic request:**
> "Book a seat for Elio movie at 13:30"

**Watch the magic happen:**

**Step 1: Information Gathering**
Your AI will realize it needs customer details and ask for them:
```
🤖 AI: To process your booking, I need your full name and email address. 
Additionally, could you please provide the specific cinema?
```

**Step 2: Availability Check**  
When you provide details like:
> "John Smith - john@email.com - UGC Ciné Cité Les Halles"

Your AI will check if that exact time is available and might respond:
```
🤖 AI: I'm sorry, but the showtime at 13:30 is unavailable. However, here are 
the available showtimes for 'Elio' at UGC Ciné Cité Les Halles:
- 13:15 ✅
- 15:30 ✅
- 17:45 ✅
- 20:00 ✅
- 22:10 ✅

Would you like to book a seat for one of these showtimes instead?
```

**Step 3: Booking Confirmation**
Choose a time like "13:15" and watch your AI complete the booking:
```
🤖 AI: Booking confirmed for 1 seat for the movie 'Elio' at 13:15.

🎫 BOOKING DETAILS:
- Confirmation ID: BK-7A95180A
- Customer: John Smith  
- Cinema: UGC Ciné Cité Les Halles
- Seats: 1 seat(s) in row A
- Total Cost: €13.50
- Confirmation Email: Sent to john@email.com
```

## Part 6: Supercharging Your AI with Expert Knowledge

### Your AI is Smart, But It Could Be Even Smarter!

Your movie assistant is already amazing at finding films, showtimes, and booking tickets. But what if it could also be an **expert on movies themselves**? 

Imagine asking your AI:
- "Tell me about the science behind Iron Man's suit"
- "What are the hidden Easter eggs in Spider-Man movies?"  
- "Who would win: Thor vs. Hulk?"
- "What's the timeline of Marvel movies?"

**This is where RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) comes in!**

### What is RAG? (In Simple Terms)

**RAG = Giving Your AI a Personal Library**

Think of it this way:
- **Before RAG:** Your AI only knows what it learned during training (like having a really smart friend with a good memory)
- **After RAG:** Your AI can instantly look up specific information from documents you give it (like having that same smart friend with access to a specialized library)

**RAG stands for:**
- **Retrieval** = Finding relevant information from documents
- **Augmented** = Adding that information to the AI's knowledge  
- **Generation** = Creating responses using both its training and the retrieved info

### Adding Marvel/MCU Expert Knowledge

**What you'll accomplish:**
- 🚀 Deploy your AI agent with a real web interface
- 🌐 Make it accessible via GitHub Pages or local hosting
- 🔧 Configure production deployment credentials  
- 📱 Share your creation with friends and family

### Understanding the Demo Interface

In your project folder, you'll find a `demo/` directory containing `index.html` - this is a professionally designed web interface for your Cinema Agent. Let's see what makes it special:

#### 🎨 What the Interface Includes:
- **Modern UI Design** - Built with IBM Carbon Design System
- **Cinema Theme** - Movie theater aesthetic with Netflix-inspired styling
- **Responsive Layout** - Works on desktop and mobile devices

- **Mobile Responsive** - Professional experience across all devices

### Step 1: Generate Your Deployment Script

The easiest way to get your deployment script is to use the built-in CLI command that automatically generates everything for you:

#### 🚀 Use the Official CLI Command:

**Open your terminal** and run:
```bash
orchestrate channels webchat embed --agent-name=YOUR_AGENT_NAME
```

**Replace `YOUR_AGENT_NAME`** with the actual name of your Cinema Agent.

> 📚 **Reference:** This approach follows the official [IBM watsonx Orchestrate Channels documentation](https://developer.watson-orchestrate.ibm.com/manage/channels)

**What happens:**
1. The command will prompt you to **provide your CRN** (if needed)
2. It automatically generates a complete `<script>` tag with all credentials filled in
3. No manual configuration required!

**Example output:**
```html
<script>
  window.wxOConfiguration = {
    orchestrationID: "your-orgID_orchestrationID",
    hostURL: "https://dl.watson-orchestrate.ibm.com", 
    rootElementID: "root",
    showLauncher: false,
    deploymentPlatform: "ibmcloud",
    crn: "your-org-crn",
    chatOptions: {
      agentId: "your-agent-id",
      agentEnvironmentId: "your-agent-env-id",
    },
    layout: {
      form: "fullscreen-overlay",
      showOrchestrateHeader: true,
      width: "600px",
      height: "600px",
    },
  };

  setTimeout(function () {
    const script = document.createElement("script");
    script.src = `${window.wxOConfiguration.hostURL}/wxochat/wxoLoader.js?embed=true`;
    script.addEventListener("load", function () {
      wxoLoader.init();
    });
    document.head.appendChild(script);
  }, 0);
</script>
```

### Step 2: Update Your Web Interface

Now you can simply copy and paste the generated script into your HTML file:

#### 📝 Update the Demo File:

**1. Open:** `demo/index.html` in any text editor

**2. Find the existing script section** (around line 290) that starts with:
```javascript
window.wxOConfiguration = {
```

**3. Replace the entire script block** with the one generated by the CLI command

**4. Customize the layout** (optional) to match our cinema theme:
```javascript
// Add or modify these properties in the generated script:
layout: {
  form: "custom",  // Use custom layout for embedded experience
  showOrchestrateHeader: false,  // Hide header for seamless integration
  customElement: document.getElementById("root")  // Embed in our container
},
style: {
  headerColor: '#E50914',  // Cinema red theme
  userMessageBackgroundColor: '#333333',  // Dark background
  primaryColor: '#E50914'  // Consistent red accent
}
```

### Step 3: Test Locally

Before deploying to the web, let's test your configuration locally:

#### 🖥️ Local Testing Options:

**Option A: Simple Python Server**
```bash
cd demo
python3 -m http.server 8000
```
Then open: `http://localhost:8000`

**Option B: Node.js Server (if you have Node installed)**
```bash
cd demo
npx serve .
